% Pythia event generation
The initial Monte Carlo event generation is performed by the Pythia event generator by generating fourth 
generation leptons at a desired mass via the Drell-Yan process.  We then translate the particle identification (PID)
code to $\pm411100$ which GEANT4 recognizes as a magnetic monopole.
% PID translation
% GEANT4 simulation

With the correct PID code, GEANT4 performs the remaining simulation of the monopole behaviour in the CMS
detector.

% mass points 
This analyiss considers monopoles simulated with the masses enumerated in Table~\ref{tab:masses}.
